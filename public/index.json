Weisner\ron Unsplash\rI am writing this from the messy middle of my career transition. I am an English graduate with no tech background, trying to enter the technical writing world. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s been a little harder than I expected, but also more exciting than I imagined along the way.\nPhoto by Glenn Carstens-Peters\ron Unsplash\rWhy Technical Writing? I spent some time exploring the concept of Ikigai—that sweet spot where what you are good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for all intersect. I kept circling back to writing.\nMy friends have told me I\u0026rsquo;m good at writing. My lecturer told me the same, proven by my writing project having low errors, great structure, solid grammar, and clear content. I genuinely enjoy my time alone for journaling and the act of typing itself. My father is a scriptwriter—maybe there\u0026rsquo;s something in the blood.\nNobody around me was talking about technical writing. Everyone was focused on content writing, copywriting, and similar roles. I thought, \u0026ldquo;If everyone can do those types of jobs, then where\u0026rsquo;s my edge?\u0026rdquo;\nI realized I actually have some interest in technology. My friends sometimes ask me about technology and stuff, and I genuinely enjoy talking about it. This is why I don\u0026rsquo;t see the AI phenomenon as a bad thing. While people around me see it that way, I see it as a tool to help us. In fact, all my curiosity and AI discussions led me into technical writing, which combines all my interests.\nThen I discovered technical writing is needed everywhere. The role seemed necessary—documentation is needed everywhere, every product needs documentation, everything needs clear guides, every software needs help articles. And I noticed something: the world seems to pay well for technical writers because it requires a rare blend of good writing and tech understanding that not many people want to develop.\nWhat I Have Done So Far I completed the Google Technical Writing Course as my introduction into technical writing. Along the way, I picked up tools as I needed them for making my technical writing projects. I created sample documentation projects to prove I could do the work. Through my trial and error, I have created several documentation pieces which you can access here—it showcases my project portfolio.\nI have tried applying to a company in my country, mainly to test the waters. Most companies had requirements I didn\u0026rsquo;t meet. All the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done went well—I got a good impression from the company I applied to. I\u0026rsquo;m not putting big hopes in becoming an office worker, since my plan is working from home. But if God puts me there, I will still be grateful. And that\u0026rsquo;s where I hit the wall.\nThe Hard Part The tech requirements can be intimidating as hell sometimes. Job listings mention tech backgrounds, programming languages, and professional technical writing experience. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any of that. When I try to learn it, it gets overwhelming in some parts. Starting from zero in tech is genuinely challenging yet exciting.\nI initially focused on creating knowledge bases and help center documentation—the kind of writing that feels closer to what I already know. But then I realized companies specifically want API documentation experience. So now I am trying to master that too, even though it feels like learning a foreign language. But I\u0026rsquo;m kind of getting used to it—it\u0026rsquo;s just new, I was only not familiar yet.\nThe Fear That is Actually Holding Me Back My biggest enemy comes from my own self: the fear of being visible, insecurity, never feeling ready, procrastination, distraction, and stuff.\nI am staring at open source repositories, trying to figure out which one to contribute to. Everyone says \u0026ldquo;just start contributing!\u0026rdquo; like it is easy. But I am scared of making mistakes publicly. What if I submit a pull request and someone points out everything I did wrong? What if my documentation suggestion is completely off-base?\nAll of this fear is probably costing me more than any lack of technical knowledge.\nWhere I Am Now Right now, my focus is on mastering different types of documentation: product and user documentation such as user training and manuals, user onboarding flows, API documentation, FAQ \u0026amp; knowledge bases, software install guides; process documentation such as internal wikis, OKRs \u0026amp; KPI reporting, video tutorials, new employee onboarding, flowcharts; also case studies. I have gotten comfortable with knowledge base creation and help center articles. Now I am pushing myself into API documentation territory because that\u0026rsquo;s where the demand seems to be.\nI am also thinking about:\nBeing more active on freelance platforms Contributing to open-source documentation Creating content to build my digital presence as a technical writer The ironic thing is I was planning to wait until I got my first job before pursuing all of that. But I am realizing that is backwards—all of them are how I will get the job.\nThis week, I am redirecting my full focus back into technical writing. No more waiting for responses, just following the systems I built. No more passive job hunting. Just building, learning, and putting myself out there.\nWhat I am Learning This transition is not linear. Some days I feel like I am making progress. Other days I wonder if I should have chosen something easier.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what I am holding onto:\nMy writing skills are valuable — clear communication is rare I don\u0026rsquo;t need to know everything — I just need to know enough to understand and explain Procrastination and distraction are my only real enemies — not lack of knowledge Starting messy is better than not starting at all — I just need to make all the projects exist first; perfection doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist The portfolio matters more than the degree — I have built real documentation samples that prove I can do this work If you are in a similar boat—no tech background and experience, wondering if you can make this work—well, I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers yet. But I am figuring it out as I go.\nAnd maybe that is the most technical writing thing of all: documenting the process, even when I am still in the middle of it. Please take all of this writing as my learning journal while I am in my technical writer transition mode.\n","title":"How I am Jumping into Technical Writing With Zero Tech Background"},{"link":"/posts/6349032/","text":"Read on my dev.to →\rMy AI-Powered Learning Journey As a person with high curiosity on random topics also enjoying trying new tools and software, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a systematic approach using AI tools that completely accelerate my learning journey and technical writing project. My process evolved from experimenting with various AI chatbot tools and ultimately combines the research power of NotebookLM with Claude\u0026rsquo;s writing assistance.\nAI usage has genuinely surprised me. I was a late adopter—people around me were already using these tools while I was still skeptical. I experienced firsthand both the negative perceptions people have about AI and its actual potential to accelerate productivity. I thought this AI phenomenon was out of my control, like I had no choice: either get left behind while people adapt to AI, or learn how AI chatbots actually work.\nNow I see AI as helpful tools, along with understanding AI ethics and use them responsibly without dishonesty. Here\u0026rsquo;s my systematic approach to using AI for accelerated learning and assisted writing:\nPhase 1: Research and Knowledge Building NotebookLM for Deep Learning Why NotebookLM became my research foundation:\nZero hallucination risk, it only provides responses based on the sources you upload and store Accepts any source format, supported file types include PDF, txt, Markdown, Audio (e.g., mp3), and various mediums: Google Drive, websites, YouTube links, or even copied text from your notes Source transparency, always shows which document supports each claim, so you can directly verify where information came from Supports multiple learning styles, whether you\u0026rsquo;re a visual, auditory, reading/writing, or VARK learner. Features include audio overview, video overview, mind maps, reports, flashcards, quizzes, and direct notes are provided. The benefits:\nResearch acceleration, synthesizes multiple sources instantly Confidence in accuracy, no hallucination concerns (compared to regular AI chatbots) Comprehensive coverage, identifies concepts I might miss My Research Process:\nGather authoritative sources, I hunt down topic-related sources from across the internet. When I can\u0026rsquo;t locate specific sources, I use NotebookLM\u0026rsquo;s discover feature to easily add relevant materials Generate study guides, let it create comprehensive overviews in their studio Extract key concepts, identify what I need to understand deeply Claude for Technical Exploration Why Claude gives me the most outstanding output compared to other AI chatbots:\nExcellent outlining, helps me create logical information architectures with clear structure and understandable purpose Consistent explanations, maintains minimal hallucination across my daily contextual discussions Straight-to-the-point responses, no fluff, just what I need Context understanding, catch my knowledge level with simple prompts The Benefits:\nConsistent quality, maintains accuracy User-focused writing, organizes information for optimal understanding Efficient iteration, quick refinements based on feedback Phase 2: Content Creation and Drafting My Hybrid Workflow Step 1: Foundation Building (NotebookLM)\nResearch topic thoroughly using stored sources Generate comprehensive study materials Identify key concepts that need clear explanation Step 2: Structure Development (Markdown or preferred notes)\nCreate content outlines based on exact needs Develop logical information flow Architecture information and draft freely Step 3: Initial Draft (Claude)\nGenerate first draft with specific requirements Enhance explanations through technical curiosity discussions with me Step 4: Refinement (Claude + manually)\nPolish language and clarity based on your exact needs Ensure consistency across sections while discussing pain points Optimize for target audience understanding Language adjustment to match my writing style (manually) Phase 3: Fact-Checking and Verification Methods My Quality Control System Primary validation (always required):\nSource validation, cross-reference against original documentation Hands-on testing, try the procedures and documentation myself Logic checking, ensure explanations make technical sense Words adjustment, refine few context to match preferred writing style Multiple source confirmation, verify critical information through professional sources or experienced writers for feedback Continuous Improvement What I track:\nWhich prompt styles generate the most accurate initial content Common verification points that need extra attention Red flags I watch for:\nOverly generic explanations (indicates I need better prompting) Missing context about limitations or edge cases Output that cannot be easily tested or verified Process evolution: My prompts have become more specific and context-rich over time, leading to better outputs and fewer revisions.\nExample of AI-Enhanced Productivity Traditional Approach AI-Enhanced Approach Research: 8+ hours reading sources NotebookLM research: 2 hours (upload docs, generate study materials) Understanding: 4+ hours concept synthesis Claude concept development: 2 hours (outlining, drafting, refining) Writing comprehensive guide: 6+ hours Hands-on verification: 3 hours (testing examples, validating claims) Total: 18+ hours Total: 10 hours (44% time savings) Quality maintained: All technical claims verified through hands-on testing, content appropriate for target audience, and comprehensive coverage without information gaps.\nWhy This Approach Actually Works The point is, Ai chatbot matches my learning style, AI supports my high curiosity to discuss and dive deeper into interesting topics. I like learning through discussion, others opinion is new perspective to be considered, help me explore and discover concepts I find unclear and unlogical, might not have considered before.\nThis methodology transforms my natural curiosity about complex topics into a systematic advantage, allowing me to master new technical domains quickly while maintaining the accuracy and user focus essential for effective writing.\nFinal Thoughts I believe every AI has its own \u0026ldquo;personality\u0026rdquo; based on how they were trained and built. I use different AI tools for different contexts, some topics work better with GPT responses, others with Gemini Pro, Copilot, Perplexity AI, or even DeepSeek. The key is understanding each tool\u0026rsquo;s strengths and applying them appropriately.\nThanks for taking the time to read my blog article!

Higher numbers mean smoother gameplay. But here’s what each tier actually feels like when you’re gaming.\nFPS Breakdown: What Each Number Means The 30 FPS tier represents bare minimum playability. It feels choppy during fast action sequences, like watching a stuttery movie. This frame rate works for turn-based strategy games, but becomes painful during first-person shooters. Most gamers target 60 FPS as the sweet spot for smooth gameplay. The jump in fluidity from 30 to 60 FPS is immediately noticeable and transformative. This frame rate works great for most games and perfectly matches standard 60 Hz monitors. Competitive players push for 120+ FPS to gain that ultra-responsive edge. The improvement over 60 FPS is noticeable but not as dramatic as the 30-to-60 jump. You need a high-refresh monitor to see the full benefit. Frame consistency matters more than peak numbers. A game averaging 60 FPS with frequent dips to 30 FPS feels worse than a rock-solid 45 FPS throughout your session.\nReading Benchmark Charts Like a Pro Don’t get distracted by just the average FPS headline number. The story lies in the details that reveal real-world performance. Look at the 1% lows, which show worst-case performance during intense gaming moments. Frame time consistency prevents that jarring stutter that ruins immersion. Resolution scaling tells you how the same GPU performs differently at 1080p versus 4K. Sometimes expensive GPUs deliver similar average FPS to cheaper alternatives. The premium usually offers better ray tracing performance, more VRAM for future games, superior upscaling technology like DLSS versus FSR, and lower power consumption.\nResolution Reality Check Your target resolution dramatically affects performance across all GPU tiers. The same graphics card can deliver vastly different experiences depending on pixel count. At 1080p, you’ll see high frame rates but often hit CPU limitations with powerful GPUs. The 1440p sweet spot balances visual quality with performance, making GPU differences more apparent. 4K gaming demands maximum GPU horsepower and creates large performance gaps between graphics cards. Consider this example: The RTX 5090 averages 157 FPS at 1080p but drops to 106 FPS at 4K. Same card, same game, massive difference in performance.\nSmart Buying Strategy Match your frame rate expectations to your actual gaming habits. Story-driven games run perfectly fine at 30-60 FPS, while action games benefit from 60-90 FPS for responsiveness. Competitive esports players gain meaningful advantages at 120+ FPS, and VR gaming demands 90+ FPS to prevent motion sickness.VRAM capacity determines your card’s longevity across future games. Target 8GB minimum for 1080p gaming, though 12GB provides better future-proofing. High-resolution 1440p and 4K gaming really benefit from 16GB VRAM to handle ultra settings and next-generation titles. Don’t ignore your monitor’s capabilities when choosing a GPU. There’s no point in buying 144 FPS performance for a 60 Hz display. Match your graphics card investment to your actual display hardware.\nBottom Line 60 FPS hits the sweet spot for most gamers. Higher FPS provides diminishing returns unless you’re competitive gaming or have a high-refresh monitor. Your resolution choice matters more than raw FPS numbers—a stable 60 FPS at 1440p often beats inconsistent 100 FPS at 4K. Focus on consistent performance over peak numbers, and match your GPU choice to your actual monitor and gaming preferences.\n","title":"Understanding GPU Benchmark Numbers: What 60 FPS Actually Means"}],"tags":[{"link":"/tags/ai-tools/","name":"AI Tools","slug":"AI Tools"},{"link":"/tags/api-reference-documentation/","name":"API Reference Documentation","slug":"API Reference Documentation"},{"link":"/tags/benchmarks/","name":"Benchmarks","slug":"Benchmarks"},{"link":"/tags/bored-api/","name":"Bored API","slug":"Bored API"},{"link":"/tags/career-transition/","name":"Career Transition","slug":"Career Transition"},{"link":"/tags/developer-docs/","name":"Developer Docs","slug":"Developer Docs"},{"link":"/tags/docs-as-code/","name":"Docs-as-Code","slug":"Docs-as-Code"},{"link":"/tags/draft/","name":"Draft","slug":"Draft"},{"link":"/tags/end-user-documentation/","name":"End-User Documentation","slug":"End-User Documentation"},{"link":"/tags/experience-based/","name":"Experience-Based","slug":"Experience-Based"},{"link":"/tags/fps/","name":"FPS","slug":"FPS"},{"link":"/tags/gaming-performance/","name":"Gaming Performance","slug":"Gaming Performance"},{"link":"/tags/gpu/","name":"GPU","slug":"GPU"},{"link":"/tags/hardware/","name":"Hardware","slug":"Hardware"},{"link":"/tags/hugo/","name":"Hugo","slug":"Hugo"},{"link":"/tags/installation-guide/","name":"Installation Guide","slug":"Installation Guide"},{"link":"/tags/journaling/","name":"Journaling","slug":"Journaling"},{"link":"/tags/knowledge-management/","name":"Knowledge-Management","slug":"Knowledge-Management"},{"link":"/tags/learning-journey/","name":"Learning Journey","slug":"Learning Journey"},{"link":"/tags/learning-process/","name":"Learning Process","slug":"Learning Process"},{"link":"/tags/markdown/","name":"Markdown","slug":"Markdown"},{"link":"/tags/mindfulness/","name":"Mindfulness","slug":"Mindfulness"},{"link":"/tags/personal-thoughts/","name":"Personal Thoughts","slug":"Personal Thoughts"},{"link":"/tags/rumination/","name":"Rumination","slug":"Rumination"},{"link":"/tags/saas/","name":"Saas","slug":"Saas"},{"link":"/tags/self-reflection/","name":"Self-Reflection","slug":"Self-Reflection"},{"link":"/tags/static-site-generator/","name":"Static Site Generator","slug":"Static Site Generator"},{"link":"/tags/technical-documentation/","name":"Technical Documentation","slug":"Technical Documentation"},{"link":"/tags/technical-writing/","name":"Technical Writing","slug":"Technical Writing"},{"link":"/tags/user-guide/","name":"User Guide","slug":"User Guide"},{"link":"/tags/workflow/","name":"Workflow","slug":"Workflow"},{"link":"/tags/zendesk/","name":"Zendesk","slug":"Zendesk"}]}
