I am writing this from the messy middle of my career transition. I am an English graduate with no tech background, trying to enter the technical writing world. Well, it's been a little harder than I expected, but also more exciting than I imagined along the way.

### **Why Technical Writing?**

I spent some time exploring the concept of Ikigai—that sweet spot where what you are good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for all intersect. I kept circling back to writing.

My friends have told me I'm good at writing. My lecturer told me the same, proven by my writing project having low errors, great structure, solid grammar, and clear content. I genuinely enjoy my time alone for journaling and the act of typing itself. My father is a scriptwriter—maybe there's something in the blood.

Nobody around me was talking about technical writing. Everyone was focused on content writing, copywriting, and similar roles. I thought, "If everyone can do those types of jobs, then where's my edge?"

I realized I actually have some interest in technology. My friends sometimes ask me about technology and stuff, and I genuinely enjoy talking about it. This is why I don't see the AI phenomenon as a bad thing. While people around me see it that way, I see it as a tool to help us. In fact, all my curiosity and AI discussions led me into technical writing, which combines all my interests.

Then I discovered technical writing is needed everywhere. The role seemed necessary—documentation is needed everywhere, every product needs documentation, everything needs clear guides, every software needs help articles. And I noticed something: the world seems to pay well for technical writers because it requires a rare blend of good writing and tech understanding that not many people want to develop.

### **What I Have Done So Far**

I completed the Google Technical Writing Course as my introduction into technical writing. Along the way, I picked up tools as I needed them for making my technical writing projects. I created sample documentation projects to prove I could do the work. Through my trial and error, I have created several documentation pieces which you can access [here](Projects.html)—it showcases my project portfolio.

I have tried applying to a company in my country, mainly to test the waters. Most companies had requirements I didn't meet. All the things I've done went well—I got a good impression from the company I applied to. I'm not putting big hopes in becoming an office worker, since my plan is working from home. But if God puts me there, I will still be grateful. And that's where I hit the wall.

### **The Hard Part**

The tech requirements can be intimidating as hell sometimes. Job listings mention tech backgrounds, programming languages, and professional technical writing experience. I don't have any of that. When I try to learn it, it gets overwhelming in some parts. Starting from zero in tech is genuinely challenging yet exciting.

I initially focused on creating knowledge bases and help center documentation—the kind of writing that feels closer to what I already know. But then I realized companies specifically want API documentation experience. So now I am trying to master that too, even though it feels like learning a foreign language. But I'm kind of getting used to it—it's just new, I was only not familiar yet.

### **The Fear That is Actually Holding Me Back**

My biggest enemy comes from my own self: the fear of being visible, insecurity, never feeling ready, procrastination, distraction, and stuff.

I am staring at open source repositories, trying to figure out which one to contribute to. Everyone says "just start contributing!" like it is easy. But I am scared of making mistakes publicly. What if I submit a pull request and someone points out everything I did wrong? What if my documentation suggestion is completely off-base?

All of this fear is probably costing me more than any lack of technical knowledge.

### **Where I Am Now**

Right now, my focus is on mastering different types of documentation: product and user documentation such as user training and manuals, user onboarding flows, API documentation, FAQ & knowledge bases, software install guides; process documentation such as internal wikis, OKRs & KPI reporting, video tutorials, new employee onboarding, flowcharts; also case studies. I have gotten comfortable with knowledge base creation and help center articles. Now I am pushing myself into API documentation territory because that's where the demand seems to be.

I am also thinking about:

-   Being more active on freelance platforms
-   Contributing to open-source documentation
-   Creating content to build my digital presence as a technical writer

The ironic thing is I was planning to wait until I got my first job before pursuing all of that. But I am realizing that is backwards—all of them are how I will get the job.

This week, I am redirecting my full focus back into technical writing. No more waiting for responses, just following the systems I built. No more passive job hunting. Just building, learning, and putting myself out there.

### **What I am Learning**

This transition is not linear. Some days I feel like I am making progress. Other days I wonder if I should have chosen something easier.

But here's what I am holding onto:

-   **My writing skills are valuable** — clear communication is rare
-   **I don't need to know everything** — I just need to know enough to understand and explain
-   **Procrastination and distraction are my only real enemies** — not lack of knowledge
-   **Starting messy is better than not starting at all** — I just need to make all the projects exist first; perfection doesn't exist
-   **The portfolio matters more than the degree** — I have built real documentation samples that prove I can do this work

If you are in a similar boat—no tech background and experience, wondering if you can make this work—well, I don't have all the answers yet. But I am figuring it out as I go.

And maybe that is the most technical writing thing of all: documenting the process, even when I am still in the middle of it. Please take all of this writing as my learning journal while I am in my technical writer transition mode.
