## Project Overview

This is (unofficial) documentation Hugo designed for Technical Writers.  
Although the focus audience is technical writer, the documentation is also useful for both new and experienced Hugo users. 

The project focuses on documentation workflows, information architecture, and content organization.

A **"Demo version"** is available on the top of this page. The project is currently in progress.

## Features

- Clear, structured documentation for learning Hugo as documentation tool
- Code examples with with syntax highlighting
- Easy navigation through well-organized content
- practical, step-by-step guidance

## Technologies Used

Technologies and tools in making this project including:
- **Hugo** as the static site generator and documentation framework, with custom theme modifications
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting and content deployment
- **GitHub** for version control and content updates
- **PowerShell** for running Hugo commands and managing the local build process 
- **Visual Studio Code** for content authoring and management
- **Markdown** for documentation authoring

## Architecture
- The docs is built using Hugo, content converted into static site HTML in the build process
- Content follows "content-first structure", separated from layout and configuration
- Documentation hierarchy is defined by front matter and directory structure
- Hugo theme used to manage layout, menus, and navigation
- Site behaviour controlled through Hugo configuration files
- Follows docs-as-code workflow, allows collaborative update and version controlled
- The final output is deployed as static site without server-side dependencies

## Challenges and Solutions

* **Understanding Hugo's folder structure**   
  → Documented the structure systematically as part of the project
* **Organizing content effectively**  
  → Used front matter and directory-based organization
* **Adapting a developer-oriented tool**      
  → Focused on documentation workflows rather than code-heavy approaches

## Future Improvements

* Expand documentation coverage and add new sections
* Improve navigation and information architecture
* Enhance visual design and layout customization
* Maintain a detailed changelog
